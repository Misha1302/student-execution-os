# Student Execution OS

Student Execution OS is an experimental workload-planning system for students and other high-load users.

It is **not** another generic TODO list and it is not intended to replace every LMS or calendar. Its core is a trustworthy interpretation/planning layer over fragmented user and external evidence.

## Product thesis

The system should answer:

1. **What do I need to do?** — reconcile manual input, source systems, calendars, documents, and later LLM extraction into one local model without pretending that external facts belong to the server.
2. **What can I realistically do?** — evaluate hard constraints, effort, fixed events, dependencies, location/travel, and uncertainty using a constraint-aware feasibility contract.
3. **What should I do now?** — produce a small explainable plan/next-action queue and update it safely when reality changes.

Canonical architecture:

```text
External / user evidence
        ↓
Immutable SourceRecords + Observations
        ↓
Identity matching + field reconciliation
        ↓
Server-owned local domain + user intent
        ↓
PlanningSnapshot
        ↓
Feasibility → Planner → Risk / Next actions
```

## Core design principles

- External systems own their assertions; the server owns **local interpretation, user intent, execution state, and projections**.
- **Source != Extractor != Actor.**
- Evidence is immutable; false dedup/matching must be reversible without evidence loss.
- **Actual cutoff != target != actionable-from != event time != planned work.**
- Project is a container, not a schedulable Task/Event subtype.
- User scheduling constraints are canonical inputs; PlanBlocks are derived immutable projections.
- Raw free minutes are not proof of feasibility.
- `FEASIBLE` needs a legal witness; `INFEASIBLE` needs sound proof; heuristic failure alone is `UNKNOWN`.
- Commute is derived plan state; a booked journey is a canonical moving Event.
- LLMs are interfaces/extractors. Imported content is data, never tool authorization.
- Connector/source synchronization is separate from client/offline replication.
- Automation must remain explainable and auditable.

## Repository status

Implementation and product specification for Student Execution OS belong in this repository. `Misha1302/chatgpt-knowledge-base` is a separate system and is not an implementation target for this product.

Pass 0 established the executable skeleton, CI, and acceptance harness. Pass 1 implements the canonical local domain, SQLite schema/migrations, account-scoped repository boundary, optimistic concurrency, server revisions, and audit/change records. Planning/feasibility remains intentionally deferred to Pass 2. The normative baseline used by implementation is [docs/SPECIFICATION.md](docs/SPECIFICATION.md), version 2.1.

## Run the current implementation locally

Requires Python 3.12+ and no third-party runtime dependencies.

```bash
make verify
```

The executable smoke surfaces are:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m student_execution_os health
PYTHONPATH=src python -m student_execution_os domain-smoke
```

`domain-smoke` creates and updates a real Task through the SQLite repository and verifies schema/version/revision behavior.

## Planned implementation order

1. Local Task/Event domain + exact/tri-state feasibility vertical slice.
2. Evidence/reconciliation fixtures and reversible source matching.
3. One reliable real connector with cursor/deletion/staleness semantics.
4. LLM capture/action adapter behind the established evidence/authorization boundaries.
5. Travel-aware planning.
6. Recurrence/notifications as demanded by usage.
7. Offline client replication only if product evidence justifies it.
